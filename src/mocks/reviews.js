    comment: `I actually found some of the scenes to be quite frightening, especially when the vampires are chasing one of their victims through their home! This scene was one of my favourites.`,

    comment: `This is Tarantino's masterpiece, there's no other way to say it. It has arguably one of the smartest scripts I've ever seen. The story, which is non-linear, is so well constructed it takes several viewings to grasp it all.`,

    comment: `ith his fifth feature film, Anderson boards another train of ironic whimsy, although this time the train is quite literal and not just the train of thought in his head.`,

    comment: `I’ve often been tempted when reviewing sequels that do nothing more than mimic their predecessors to simply reprint what I wrote on the original film. “The Darjeeling Limited” marks the first time I’ve considered doing that for a non-sequel.`,
